# ClassProjects
These are some of my class projects throughout school

This banking app was for my Java II course. The main points of this app were to create a GUI, and work with a database (SQlite).

The functionality is all there -- except for delete operations. You can create and update customers. 

NOTE: To be able to deposit or withdraw "money" from a user created account, you have to create a customer AND a savings account for that customer. Not the best functionality for and end user, undoubtedly, but it was the best way to show that the functionality of the Customer and SavingsAccount classes had separation -- and it was also way to add new customers to existing accounts.
